#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To make sure my software works properly and is secure, I run many tests using tools like Apache Maven, Surefire, and Jacoco. These tools help me check most parts of my software to find and fix bugs or security issues early. I always check inputs to avoid errors and threats, and I try to make my software run smoothly by using resources wisely and keeping things simple.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To understand and meet user needs in my software, I start by thinking about the needs of the users, such as easy ways to manage contacts or schedule appointments. I regularly ask for feedback to improve the software's features and how it looks and feels. Testing the software in real-life situations helps me make sure it does what users need it to do.

#How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I organize it into clear parts, each handling a specific job. This makes it easier to manage and update. Keeping detailed notes on everything I do during the project helps anyone who works on it later understand what I did and why. I think about security from the beginning to avoid problems, and I plan my tests thoroughly to ensure the software is well-coded and works properly.
